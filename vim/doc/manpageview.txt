2. ManPageView Options					*manpageview-options*

	g:manpageview_options : extra options that will be passed on when
	                        invoking the man command
	  examples:
	            let g:manpageview_options= "-P 'cat -'"
	            let g:manpageview_options= "-c"
	            let g:manpageview_options= "-Tascii"
	
	g:manpageview_winopen : may take on one of six values:

	   "only"    man page will become sole window.
	             Side effect: All windows' contents will be saved first!  (windo w)
	             Use :q to terminate the manpage and restore the window setup.
	             Note that mksession is used for this option, hence the
	             +mksession configure-option is required.
	   "hsplit"  man page will appear in a horizontally          split window (default)
	   "vsplit"  man page will appear in a vertically            split window
	   "hsplit=" man page will appear in a horizontally & evenly split window
	   "vsplit=" man page will appear in a vertically   & evenly split window
	   "reuse"   man page will re-use current window.  Use <ctrl-o> to return.
"                    (for the reuse option, thanks go to Alan Schmitt)
	
	g:manpageview_server : for WinNT; uses rsh to read manpage remotely
	g:manpageview_user   : use given server (host) and username
	  examples:
	            let g:manpageview_server= "somehostname"
	            let g:manpageview_user  = "username"

==============================================================================

3. ManPageView Usage					*manpageview-usage*

	:Man topic
	:Man topic booknumber
	:Man booknumber topic
	:Man topic(booknumber)
	:Man      -- will restore position prior to use of :Man
	             (only for g:manpageview_winopen == "only")
	Put cursor on topic, press "K" while in normal mode

	If your "man" command requires options, you may specify them
	with the g:manpageview_options variable in your <.vimrc>.

3. ManPageView History					*manpageview-history*

	Thanks go to the various people who have contributed changes,
	pointed out problems, and made suggestions!

	7 : * when a manpageview window is exit'd, it will be wiped out
	      so that it doesn't clutter the buffer list
	    * when g:manpageview_winopen was "reuse", the manpage would
	      reuse the window, even when it wasn't a manpage window.
	      Manpageview will now use hsplit if the window was marked
	      "modified"; otherwise, the associated buffer will be marked
	      as "hidden" (so that its still available via the buffer list)
	6 : * Erik Remmelzwal provided a fix to the g:manpageview_server
	      support for NT
	    * implemented Erik's suggestion to re-use manpage windows
	    * Nathan Huizinga pointed out, <cWORD> was picking up too much for
	      the K map. <cword> is now used
	    * Denilson F de Sa suggested that the man-page window be set as
	      readonly and nonmodifiable

	5 : includes g:manpageview_winmethod option (only, hsplit, vsplit)

	4 : Erik Remmelzwaal suggested including, for the benefit of NT users,
	    a command to use rsh to read the manpage remotely.  Set
	    g:manpageview_server to hostname  (in your <.vimrc>)
	    g:manpageview_user   to username

	3 : * ignores (...) if it contains commas or double quotes.  elides
	      any commas, colons, and semi-colons at end

	    * g:manpageview_options supported

	2 : saves current session prior to invoking man pages :Man    will
	    restore session.  Requires +mksession for this new command to
	    work.

	1 : the epoch
